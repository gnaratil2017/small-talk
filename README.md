# Small Talk: A Mobile Application to Start Conversations

Small Talk is a mobile application for both Android and iOS that provides users a clean and simple way to access the most recently trending information on a variety of popular topics. The app aggregates content from multiple sources (news, YouTube, Twitter), giving users the ability to quickly and conveniently reference this information in one location on their phone, the Small Talk app. In addition to pulling and displaying trending information from various online sources, Small Talk also provides users with the ability to filter content based on categories of general conversation topics. The news articles, YouTube videos, and Twitter topics listed in Small Talk are placed into these conversation categories based on votes casted by the users themselves. Small Talk acts as an aggregator in order to keep its users up to date with a healthy combination of current trends, news, and videos breaking the internet so that they never feel left out of conversations and instead will be the ones starting conversations. With the intuitive user interface of Small Talk, browsing content is a simple and seamless process for the user. Small Talk has been developed with a React Native frontend (with MobX for application state management) and an Express in Node.js backend. Small Talk’s frontend is based around a card UI design with smart UI and UX principles put into practice. Small Talk’s backend, which has been deployed on Heroku, depends upon interactions with the News API, YouTube API, and Twitter API. MongoDB Atlas is used to host and manage Small Talk’s database.
